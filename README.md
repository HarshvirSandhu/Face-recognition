Face Recognition At varying angles and partially visible face
1. The data(images) should be taken with a similar camera which will be used for face recognition at various distances and angles.
2. Once a face is recognised, a video will be saved as long as the face is being recognised. The saved video will also display the date and time at which the face was detected.
